# ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ RS14-passerine ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶

A simple program for writing down sheet music. Inspired by Super Mario Paint Composer

## Prerequisites

In order to build this tool you will need to have the ALSA(Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) library installed on your Linux system. It usually comes with the system but if not, simple install libasound2-dev with your favorite package manager should do the trick. 

## Usage

It's pretty useless at the moment.
